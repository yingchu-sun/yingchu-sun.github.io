I design computational and engineering systems that connect **neural activity** to **perception and behavior**.  
My work combines **high-density BCI**, **multimodal imaging system**, and **machine learning models** to understand and restore visual/motor functions.

At Rice University, I build end-to-end pipelines that record from the **mouse LGN with 128-channel ultraflexible probes**, design **visual and microstimulation experiments**, and develop **neural encoding/decoding models** that reconstruct visual information directly from population activity. I also create **closed-loop behavioral systems**, integrating deep learning tracking, real-time control, and neural decoders to study how the brain represents and transforms motor learning over time.

My long-term goal is to **understand how light is encoded**, **perceive how it shapes neural systems**, and **build technologies that create new forms of light-driven experience**.

**Understand light.**
**Feel light.**
**Create light.**
